# pet-pdf-to-audio
This Python-based project, "PDF to Audio Converter," is designed to enhance accessibility and user convenience by transforming any PDF document into an audible format. Leveraging powerful Python libraries, this tool is ideal for users who prefer auditory learning or require audio assistance for reading texts.
Key Features:

PDF Reading: Automatically parses text from PDF files using Python libraries like PyPDF2 or pdfplumber.
Text-to-Speech: Converts extracted text into speech using a text-to-speech library such as gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) for natural sounding voice output.
Customizable Audio Output: Users can adjust the speech rate, volume, and voice accents to suit their preferences.
Batch Processing: Supports converting multiple PDF files to audio format in a single session, making it efficient for handling bulk conversions.
Technologies Used:

Python 3.x
Libraries: PyPDF2/pdfplumber for PDF text extraction and gTTS/pyttsx3 for generating audio.
This tool is open-source, and I welcome contributions and suggestions to make it more versatile and user-friendly. Feel free to fork this repository and submit your pull requests or create issues for any bugs or new features you'd like to see.
